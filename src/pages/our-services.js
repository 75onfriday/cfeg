                    Credit recovery is a term used to describe the retaking of a
                    course. High Schoolers can retake courses they failed or
                    retake courses to improve a grade. Recovery classes reteach
                    only the concepts or lessons you did not understand during
                    the school year. Depending on how much time you spend on
                    your coursework, you can finish a course in as little as 2
                    weeks. If you have a grade of 59 or 69 you should retake the
                    classes as a recovery course. If your grade point
                    average(GPA) is 70 or 75 you should consider retaking
                    classes with grades of 70â€™s to improve your overall GPA.
                    Failure is not an option so make sure you sign up with our
                    course recovery program at CFEG we are here for you.

                    Our Summer School Program offers students an opportunity to
                    take core classes they failed during the school year.
                    Students have six weeks to complete the courses and can take
                    up to 2 classes for a full credit. The credits can be
                    transferred to their home school. Students should bring a
                    summer school referral form with a final report card
                    attached from their home school counselor or school
                    registrar. The cost of our summer school is $175.00
